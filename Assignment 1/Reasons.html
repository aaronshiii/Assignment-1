        <p>I decided to take CPSC 349 because I wanted to diversify and learn more languages to see what I like and don't like.</p>
        <p>I have never learned HTML however, I have edited HTML code to make my Tumblr and Myspace homepages or something.</p>
        <p>Other than that, this is my first time actually sitting down and trying to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript\!</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>I'm hoping to learn as much as possible to see if this is something I can see myself do in the future.</p>
        <p>Maybe I can make my own website or use this in the future to further my career. Who knows but we'll have to wait and see...</p>
